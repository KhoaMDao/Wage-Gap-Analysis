# Understanding the Gender Wage Gap: A Comparative Analysis of Income Disparities with Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project investigates the gender wage gap in the United States using multivariate regression analysis. We use the IPUMS USA dataset, focusing on factors such as gender, geographic location, age, race, and field of degree to analyze income disparities. Our goal is to quantify the extent of the gender wage gap and understand the underlying factors contributing to this disparity.
